# AOM_Mar_Apr

This is a solution to the Algorithm of Month March&April at Sherborne School.

The problem was:

A rectangular grid defines a laser-tag arena.    In the arena are b  smaller-shaped rectangular barriers placed at any place, randomly in the arena but so that  no part of the arena becomes cut-off from the rest and are horizontal or vertical.  M mirrors of random length (but less than the arena wall) are placed on the walls of the arena so that there is a gap between them of at least one grid-square.  There is at least one mirror on each wall.  P players start off in the grid in random locations at the beginning of the game with laser guns.  The barriers absorb laser light.  The mirrors perfectly reflect the laser light.   A player perfectly absorbs light. One of the P players cheats and fires their laser early.  Modelling the laser as a single light particle, out who gets shot, if anyone?   The person who cheated the person shot are eliminated.  After the game starts for real, each Player has s shots.   They shoot at different times in order. After each shot, each player moves randomly one grid position (vertically, diagonally or horizontally).   Who wins the game?   What is the best starting position in the arena?
